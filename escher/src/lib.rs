//! > Self-referencial structs using async stacks
//!
//! Escher is an extremely simple library providing a safe and sound API to build
//! self-referencial structs. It works by (ab)using the async await trasformation
//! of rustc. If you'd like to know more about the inner workings please take a
//! look at the [How it works](#how-it-works) section and the source code.
//!
//! Compared to the state of the art escher:
//!
//! * Is only around 100 lines of well-commented code
//! * Contains only two `unsafe` calls that are well argued for
//! * Uses rustc for all the analysis. If it compiles, the self references are correct
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This library provides the `Escher<T>` wrapper type that can hold self-referencial data and
//! expose them safely through the `as_ref()` and `as_mut()` functions.
//!
//! You construct a self reference by calling Escher's constructor and providing a closure that
//! will initialize your self-references on its stack. Your closure will be provided with a
//! parameter `r` that has a single `capture()` method that consumes `r`.
//!
//! > Note: It is important to `.await` the result `.capture()` in order for escher to correctly
//! initialize your struct.
//!
//! Once all the data and references are created you can capture the desired ones. Simple
//! references to owned data can be captured directly (see first example).
//!
//! To capture more than one variable or capture references to non-owned data you will have to
//! define your own reference struct that derives `Escher` (see second example).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## A `Vec<u8>` and `&str` reference of its data.
//!
//! The simplest way to use Escher is to create a reference of some data and then capture it:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use escher::Escher;
//!
//! let escher_heart = Escher::new(|r| async move {
//!     let data: Vec<u8> = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];
//!     let sparkle_heart = std::str::from_utf8(&data).unwrap();
//!
//!     r.capture(sparkle_heart).await;
//! });
//!
//! assert_eq!("ðŸ’–", *escher_heart.as_ref());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Same as above but expose both the `Vec<u8>` and `&str`
//!
//! In order to capture more than one things you can define a struct that will be used to capture
//! the variables:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use escher::Escher;
//!
//! #[derive(Escher)]
//! struct VecStr<'this> {
//!     data: &'this Vec<u8>,
//!     s: &'this str,
//! }
//!
//! let escher_heart = Escher::new(|r| async move {
//!     let data: Vec<u8> = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];
//!
//!     r.capture(VecStr{
//!         data: &data,
//!         s: std::str::from_utf8(&data).unwrap(),
//!     }).await;
//! });
//!
//! assert_eq!(240, escher_heart.as_ref().data[0]);
//! assert_eq!("ðŸ’–", escher_heart.as_ref().s);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Mutable `&mut str` view into a `Vec<u8>`
//!
//! If you capture a mutable reference to some piece of data then you cannot capture the data as
//! well like the previous example. This is mandatory as doing otherwise would create two mutable
//! references into the same piece of data that is not allowed.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use escher::Escher;
//!
//! let mut name = Escher::new(|r| async move {
//!     let mut data: Vec<u8> = vec![101, 115, 99, 104, 101, 114];
//!     let name = std::str::from_utf8_mut(&mut data).unwrap();
//!
//!     r.capture(name).await;
//! });
//!
//! assert_eq!("escher", *name.as_ref());
//! name.as_mut().make_ascii_uppercase();
//! assert_eq!("ESCHER", *name.as_ref());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Multiple mixed references
//!
//! ```rust
//! use escher::Escher;
//!
//! #[derive(Escher)]
//! struct MyStruct<'this> {
//!     int_data: &'this Box<i32>,
//!     int_ref: &'this i32,
//!     float_ref: &'this mut f32,
//! }
//!
//! let mut my_value = Escher::new(|r| async move {
//!     let int_data = Box::new(42);
//!     let mut float_data = Box::new(3.14);
//!
//!     r.capture(MyStruct{
//!         int_data: &int_data,
//!         int_ref: &int_data,
//!         float_ref: &mut float_data,
//!     }).await;
//! });
//!
//! assert_eq!(Box::new(42), *my_value.as_ref().int_data);
//! assert_eq!(3.14, *my_value.as_ref().float_ref);
//!
//! *my_value.as_mut().float_ref = (*my_value.as_ref().int_ref as f32) * 2.0;
//!
//! assert_eq!(84.0, *my_value.as_ref().float_ref);
//! ```
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! ## The problem with self-references
//!
//! The main problem with self-referencial structs is that if such a struct was
//! somehow constructed the compiler would then have to statically prove that it
//! would not move again. This analysis is necessary because any move would
//! invalidate self-pointers since all pointers in rust are absolute memory
//! addresses.
//!
//! To illustrate why this is necessary, imagine we define a self-referencial
//! struct that holds a Vec and a pointer to it at the same time:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! struct Foo {
//!     s: Vec<u8>,
//!     p: &Vec<u8>,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Then, let's assume we had a way of getting an instance of this struct. We could
//! then write the following code that creates a dangling pointer in safe rust!
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let foo = Foo::magic_construct();
//!
//! let bar = foo; // move foo to a new location
//! println!("{:?}", bar.p); // access the self-reference, memory error!
//! ```
//!
//! ![Moves invalidate pointer](https://github.com/petrosagg/escher/blob/master/assets/moves-invalidate-pointer.png?raw=true)
//!
//! ## Almost-self-references on the stack
//!
//! While rust doesn't allow you to explicitly write out self referencial struct
//! members and initialize them it is perfectly valid to write out the values of
//! the members individually as separate stack bindings. This is because the borrow
//! checker *can* do a move analysis when the values are on the stack.
//!
//! Practically, we could convert the struct `Foo` from above to individual
//! bindings like so:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! fn foo() {
//!     let s = vec![1, 2, 3];
//!     let p = &s;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Then, we could wrap both of them in a struct that only has references and use that instead:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! struct AlmostFoo<'a> {
//!     s: &'a Vec<u8>,
//!     p: &'a Vec<u8>,
//! }
//!
//! fn make_foo() {
//!     let s = vec![1, 2, 3];
//!     let p = &s;
//!
//!     let foo = AlmostFoo { s, p };
//!
//!     do_stuff(foo); // call a function that expects an AlmostFoo
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Of course `make_foo()` cannot return an `AlmostFoo` instance since it would be
//! referencing values from its stack, but what it can do is call other functions
//! and pass an `AlmostFoo` to them. In other words, as long as the code that wants
//! to use `AlmostFoo` is above `make_foo()` we can use this technique and work
//! with almost-self-references.
//!
//! ![Almost self-reference](https://github.com/petrosagg/escher/blob/master/assets/almost-foo.png?raw=true)
//!
//! This is pretty restrictive though. Ideally we'd lke to be able return some
//! owned value and be free to move it around, put it on the heap, etc.
//!
//! ## Actually returning an `AlmostFoo`
//!
//! > **Note:** The description of async stacks bellow is not what actually happens
//! > in rustc but is enough to illustrate the point. `escher`'s API does make use
//! > that the desired values are held across an await point to force them to be
//! > included in the generated Future.
//!
//! As we saw, it is impossible to return an `AlmostFoo` instance since it
//! references values from the stack. But what if we could freeze the stack after
//! an `AlmostFoo` instance got constructed and then returned the whole stack?
//!
//! Well, there is no way for a regular function to capture its own stack and
//! return it but that is exactly what the async/await transformation does! Let's
//! make `make_foo` from above async and also make it never terminate:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! async fn make_foo() {
//!     let s = vec![1, 2, 3];
//!     let p = &s;
//!     let foo = AlmostFoo { s, p };
//!     std::future::pending().await
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now when someone calls `make_foo()` what they get back is some struct that
//! implements Future. This struct is in fact a representation of the stack of
//! `make_foo` at its initial state, i.e in the state that the function has not be
//! called yet.
//!
//! What we need to do now is to step the execution of the returned Future until
//! the instance of `AlmostFoo` is constructed. In this case we know that there is
//! a single await point so we only need to poll the Future once. Before we do that
//! though we need to put it in a Pinned Box to ensure that as we poll the future
//! no moves will occur. This is the same restriction as with normal function but
//! with async it is enforced using the `Pin<P>` type.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let foo = make_foo(); // construct a stack that will eventually make an AlmostFoo in it
//! let mut foo = Box::pin(foo_fut); // pin it so that it never moves again
//! foo.poll(); // poll it once
//!
//! // now we know that somewhere inside `foo` there is a valid AlmostFoo instance!
//! ```
//!
//! We're almost there! We now have an owned value, the future, that somewhere
//! inside it has an AlmostFoo instance. However we have no way of retrieving the
//! exact memory location of it or accessing it in any way. The Future is opaque.
//!
//! ![Async stack](https://github.com/petrosagg/escher/blob/master/assets/async-stack.png?raw=true)
//!
//! ## Putting it all together
//!
//! `escher` builds upon the techniques described above and provides a solution for
//! getting the pointer from within the opaque future struct. Each `Escher<T>`
//! instance holds a Pinned Future and a raw pointer to T. The pointer to T is
//! computed by polling the Future just enough times for the desired T to be
//! constructed.
//!
//! As its API, it provides the `as_ref()` and `as_mut()` methods that unsafely
//! turn the raw pointer to T into a &T with its lifetime bound to the lifetime of
//! `Escher<T>` itself. This ensures that the future will outlive any usage of the
//! self-reference!
//!
//! Thank you for reading this far! If you would like to learn how escher uses the
//! above concepts in detail please take a look at the implementation.
